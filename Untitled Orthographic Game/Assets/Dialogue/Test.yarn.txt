    This is a test of the branching dialogue system.
    
    -> Okay
        I hope this system actually works.
    -> Sweet
        I'm glad you love it.
    -> I hate this.
        Too bad.
    
    <<gesture Cara acknowledging>> 
    Anyway, every dialogue option has the ability to change my reaction.
    
    For instance, I will react differently to different choices.

    -> Angry choice.
        <<gesture Cara angry>> 
        I'm angry.
    -> Happy choice.
        <<gesture Cara happy>> 
        I'm happy.
    -> Sad choice.
        <<gesture Cara dismissing>> 
        I'm sad.
    
    I am also able to remember and recognize things that you have done in the environment.

    <<if $Book_Alice is true>>
        For instance, I know that you picked up Alice in Wonderland over there.
    <<elseif $Book_Frank is true>>
        For instance, I know that you picked up Frankenstein over there.
    <<elseif $Book_Pride is true>>
        For instance, I know that you picked up Pride and Prejudice over there.
    <<else>>
        For instance, I know you haven't read any of the books in the house.
    << endif>> 

    <<if $Coffee_Cara is true>>
        I also know that you interacted with my coffee over in the kitchen.
    <<else>>
        I also know that you didn't notice my coffee sitting in the kitchen.
    <<endif>> 

    <<gesture Cara acknowledging>> 
    For now, that is all I have for you.
<<else>>
    <<gesture Cara annoyed>> 
    I already talked to you.
    <<gesture Cara angry>> 
    I don't have anything else to say.
<<endif>>
