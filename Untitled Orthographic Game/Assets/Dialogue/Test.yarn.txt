    This is a test of the branching dialogue system.
    
    -> Okay
        <<gesture NPC acknowledging>> 
        I hope this system actually works.
    -> Sweet
        <<gesture NPC acknowledging>> 
        I'm glad you love it.
    -> I hate this.
        <<gesture NPC acknowledging>> 
        Too bad.
    
    <<gesture NPC weight-shift>> 
    Anyway, every dialogue option has the ability to change my reaction.
    
    For instance, I will react differently to different choices.
    
    -> Angry choice.
        <<gesture NPC angry>> 
        I'm angry.
    -> Happy choice.
        <<gesture NPC happy>> 
        I'm happy.
    -> Sad choice.
        <<gesture NPC dismissing>> 
        I'm sad.
    
    <<gesture NPC acknowledging>> 
    For now, that is all I have for you.
<<else>>
    <<gesture NPC annoyed>> 
    I already talked to you!
    <<gesture NPC angry>> 
    Punk!
